  The auto-generated CS files are initially placed in the Obj folder:
    _build\obj\Debug-AnyCPU\SDK\RawClient-Managed\<TargetFx>\temporal\**\*.cs
  and
    _build\obj\Debug-AnyCPU\SDK\RawClient-Managed\<TargetFx>\dependencies\**\*.cs
  
  They are build into the binary assembly FROM THERE.
  
  We MANUALLY copy them into $(AutoGenOutputBaseDir) so that we can diff them with earlier versons as a part of code review.
  We need to make sure that the copy is not included into the complication to avoid duplicated. This is done below.
  In the long term, that copy process needs to be automated. Ideally, just emit the auto-gen into $(AutoGenOutputBaseDir).
  For that we need to find a resolution or a workaround for 
    https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/29161
  Then, `OutputDir` and `GrpcOutputDir` below will need to be moved into the `Protobuf` item set definition.
  
  However, we can also create a target that will just copy the files out of the Obj folder:
    <Target Name="CopyAutoGenFilesIntoProjectFolder" AfterTargets="Build">
      <Copy ... />...</Copy> 
    </Target>
